## Intro and purpose
The Vintage Store e-commerce website is developed for the Milestone project 5 of Code Institute Diploma in Software with eCommerce.

The Vintage Store is an e-commerce application built in Django, Python, CSS and HTML.

## Project status
The project is incomplete and requires further development. Due to time constraints, a large part of the projected application remains undeveloped. 
The initial development of the project is based on the Boutique Ado project.
In addition, there has been a security error, as inadvertently during development a content of env.py has been included in the commit to Github. Whilst this part has been partly remediated, there is additional work needed to address this significant security concern.
